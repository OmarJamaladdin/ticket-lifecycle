Here I am creating tickets as an end-user of osTicket.com. These tickets will be submitted to osTicket and I will then receive and solve  these tickets as a help desk professional on the other end.

Here is the intake process of the ticket I created earlier from Karen (End-User). In this screenshot I am now Jane Doe (Sys Admin). I have received the ticket and made changes to the ticket due to the severity of the ticket that the end-user wasn't aware of. Customers not being able to use online banking is a serious issue so I set the priority of the ticket to 'EMERGENCY" and set the SLA or (Service Level Agreement) to Sev-A. Meaning the ticket must be solved within 1 hour of receiving it.
